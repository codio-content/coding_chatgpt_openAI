Using the ChatGPT API for best practices and code optimization can help developers improve their coding skills and enhance the quality of their code. By employing effective techniques for requesting guidance and working with the provided suggestions, you can elevate your programming expertise and create more efficient, maintainable, and robust code.

Consider the following API call to obtain guidance on Python naming conventions:
```python
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a coding assistant with expertise in Python."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are some best practices for naming variables and functions in Python?"}
    ]
```
{Try it!}(python3 aware.py 1)
In this example, the user query explicitly requests guidance on Python naming conventions. The system message sets the context of the AI as a coding assistant with expertise in Python.

Now consider the following API call to optimize a JavaScript code snippet:

```python
[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a coding assistant with expertise in JavaScript."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "I have this JavaScript code: `function add(a, b) { return a + b; }`. Can you suggest any improvements or optimizations?"}
    ]
``` 
{Try it!}(python3 aware.py 2)
In this example, the user query provides a JavaScript code snippet and requests suggestions for improvements or optimizations. The system message sets the context of the AI as a coding assistant with expertise in JavaScript.

Techniques for Requesting Best Practices and Optimization:

1. **Be specific**: Clearly describe the area of code or programming concept for which you need guidance on best practices.
2. **Provide context**: Include any relevant background information, constraints, or requirements that may affect the implementation of best practices or optimization.
3. **Use system messages:** Set the context of the AI as a coding assistant with expertise in the programming language or domain you are working with.
