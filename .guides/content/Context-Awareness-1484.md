**Context awareness** plays a critical role in generating meaningful and accurate responses using the ChatGPT API interactions. By providing context through user queries and system messages, you can guide the AI to generate responses that address user intent, requirements, and constraints effectively. Before moving further into code explanation, lets discuss context awareness.


Providing context in ChatGPT API interactions ensures that the AI understands the user's intent, background information, and any specific requirements or constraints. By supplying adequate context, you can obtain more accurate, relevant, and helpful responses from the AI.

Methods for Providing Context:
1. **User queries**: Formulate clear and explicit user queries that include relevant information, constraints, and requirements.
2. **System messages**: Use system messages to set the initial context, define the AI's role, or provide domain-specific guidance.

Lets try going over it using non-coding example to better help with understanding!  Please pay specific attention to the roles and content of our queries. For the following code you are provided a `message` variable and paste the following into the message variable Consider the following ambiguous user query:

```python
[  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to cook it?"}]

```
{Try it!}(python3 aware.py)

In comparison, Adding context through user query:

```python
[  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to cook quinoa?"}]
```
{Try it!}(python3 aware.py 2)
In this example, by specifying "quinoa" in the user query, the AI can generate a more accurate response regarding cooking methods for that specific ingredient. 

Setting context through system message:
```python
[  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant with expertise in cooking."},  
{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to cook quinoa?"}]
```
{Try it!}(python3 aware.py 3)

By adding a system message indicating expertise in cooking, the AI is guided to provide more detailed and accurate cooking instructions for quinoa.

Combining context from user query and system message:

```python
[  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant with expertise in plant-based diets."},  
{"role": "user", "content": "What's the best way to cook quinoa for a vegan meal?"}]
```
{Try it!}(python3 aware.py 4)

In this example, both the system message and user query provide context that ensures the AI generates a response tailored to vegan meal preparation.
