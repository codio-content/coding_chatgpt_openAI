-------------
The ChatGPT API can be a valuable resource for generating code snippets in various programming languages, helping users streamline their development process. In this lesson, we will discuss techniques for structuring user queries and system messages to obtain accurate code examples and tips for getting the most out of the ChatGPT API for coding purposes.

Techniques for Generating Code Snippets:

1. **Be explicit in user queries**: When requesting code snippets, specify the programming language, desired functionality, and any relevant context or constraints. The clearer the query, the more accurate and useful the generated code snippet will be.
2. **Leverage system messages**: Use a system message to set the context of the AI as a coding assistant with expertise in the programming language you are working with.
3. **Provide code examples**: If possible, include examples of input and output data, or provide a code skeleton for the AI to work with. This helps the AI generate more accurate and relevant code snippets.

There are two files on the left side. `temp.py` will be what we use to interact with the API. The other file `test.py`, will be used to paste in the code generated by the API call.
Consider the following API call to generate a Python code snippet:

```python
response=openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a coding assistant with expertise in Python."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function to find the factorial of a given number using recursion."}
    ]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip())
```

{Try it!}(python3 temp.py)

In this example, the user query explicitly mentions the programming language (Python), the desired functionality (factorial), and the technique (recursion). The system message sets the context of the AI as a coding assistant with expertise in Python. Copy and paste the code being generated to the bottom left box. The button below is provided to help run it.

**Always** review the generated code snippet for correctness, completeness, and adherence to best practices. Part of the review process involves testing the generated code snippet in your development environment to ensure it works as expected and to identify any potential issues or errors. If the generated code snippet does not fully meet your requirements, adapt and refine the code as needed, or provide additional context and constraints in your user query.
